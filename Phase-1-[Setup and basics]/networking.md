# Phase 1 ‚Äì Networking (Cloud Security Foundation)

This phase is about building a **solid networking foundation** with a focus on **cloud security engineering**.  
Networking is the backbone of all cloud systems, and security relies heavily on understanding **how data flows, which protocols are used, and where vulnerabilities exist**.

## üìö What I Learned  

### 1. Networking Fundamentals  
- **OSI Model (7 layers)** ‚Äì crucial for mapping security tools like firewalls (Layer 3/4), TLS encryption (Layer 6), and WAFs (Layer 7).  
- **TCP/IP Model (4 layers)** ‚Äì simplified model widely used in real-world networking and the cloud.  
- **Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer** ‚Äì understanding how cloud services use client-server, and how P2P introduces unique risks.  
- **IP Addressing & Subnetting** ‚Äì foundation of cloud **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** design.  
- **MAC Addresses & ARP** ‚Äì and their security risks (ARP spoofing attacks).  

### 2. Security-Relevant Protocols  
- **TCP** ‚Äì reliable, connection-oriented, ensures ordered delivery. Secure services (HTTPS, SSH) rely on it.  
- **UDP** ‚Äì faster but unreliable, often exploited in **DDoS attacks** (e.g., amplification).  
- **HTTP/HTTPS** ‚Äì stateless web protocol. HTTPS adds TLS encryption ‚Üí critical for cloud web security.  
- **DNS** ‚Äì enables hostname-to-IP mapping. Vulnerable to **DNS spoofing, poisoning, hijacking**.  
- **DHCP** ‚Äì automates IP assignment, but attackers may run rogue DHCP servers.  
- **ICMP** ‚Äì used in ping/traceroute, but also reconnaissance and flooding attacks.  

### 3. Ports & Services  
- **Well-known ports** (0‚Äì1023) are frequent attack targets. Examples:  
  - `80` ‚Äì HTTP  
  - `443` ‚Äì HTTPS (encrypted)  
  - `25` ‚Äì SMTP (email)  
  - `53` ‚Äì DNS  
- In cloud, **restricting ports via firewalls/security groups** is a key defense mechanism.  

### 4. Practical Commands for Security Engineers  
- `ping`, `traceroute` ‚Äì check connectivity & detect routing issues.  
- `ipconfig` / `ifconfig` ‚Äì network configs during **incident response**.  
- `netstat` ‚Äì monitor open/suspicious connections.  
- `nslookup` / `dig` ‚Äì detect DNS misconfigurations or spoofing.  
- `curl` / `wget` ‚Äì inspect HTTP responses, test TLS, APIs.  

### 5. Tools & Security Use Cases  
- **Wireshark** ‚Äì packet analysis, intrusion detection, malware traffic analysis.  
- **Nmap** ‚Äì port scanning, vulnerability detection.  
- **SSH vs Telnet** ‚Äì secure vs insecure remote login.  
- **Firewalls & Security Groups** ‚Äì applying least privilege at the network layer.

*This 4-hour video by Kunal Kushwaha was the **perfect starting point** for me.  
I completed it over two days and it helped me clearly understand how data is transferred across networks and how models like OSI & TCP/IP actually work.  
Instead of just memorizing theory, I gained **conceptual clarity** and a practical perspective on networking fundamentals.  
I highly recommend this course to beginners, whether pursuing a **tech or non-tech career**, as networking basics are universally valuable.*

## üí° Tips & Tricks I Learned  
- Map all troubleshooting to the **OSI model**.  
- Default open ports (22, 80, 443) = highest attack surface.  
- DNS is one of the most **exploited services** ‚Üí always monitor.  
- Use **private subnets** + security groups in cloud deployments.  
- Always check traffic logs (VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, Wireshark).
