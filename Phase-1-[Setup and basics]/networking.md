# Phase 1 ‚Äì Networking (Cloud Security Foundation)

This phase is about building a **solid networking foundation** with a focus on **cloud security engineering**.  
Networking is the backbone of all cloud systems, and security relies heavily on understanding **how data flows, which protocols are used, and where vulnerabilities exist**.

## üìö What I Learned  

### 1. Networking Fundamentals  
- **OSI Model (7 layers)** ‚Äì crucial for mapping security tools like firewalls (Layer 3/4), TLS encryption (Layer 6), and WAFs (Layer 7).  
- **TCP/IP Model (4 layers)** ‚Äì simplified model widely used in real-world networking and the cloud.  
- **Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer** ‚Äì helps understand how cloud services communicate and why centralized client-server models dominate cloud.  
- **IP Addressing & Subnetting** ‚Äì essential for designing secure **VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds)** in AWS/Azure.  
- **MAC Addresses & ARP** ‚Äì learned their importance and how attacks like **ARP spoofing** can compromise networks.  

### 2. Security-Relevant Protocols  
- **TCP** ‚Äì reliable, ordered delivery. Basis for secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH).  
- **UDP** ‚Äì faster but unreliable, exploited in **DDoS amplification attacks**.  
- **HTTP/HTTPS** ‚Äì stateless web protocol, with HTTPS securing traffic via TLS encryption.  
- **DNS** ‚Äì critical but vulnerable to **spoofing and poisoning**.  
- **DHCP** ‚Äì simplifies IP assignment, but rogue DHCP servers can cause attacks.  
- **ICMP** ‚Äì useful for troubleshooting but often abused for reconnaissance.  

### 3. Ports & Services  
- **Well-known ports** (0‚Äì1023) are the most attacked. Key examples:  
  - `80` ‚Üí HTTP  
  - `443` ‚Üí HTTPS (encrypted)  
  - `25` ‚Üí SMTP (email)  
  - `53` ‚Üí DNS  
- In the cloud, these are **controlled with firewalls and security groups**.  

### 4. Practical Commands for Security Engineers  
- `ping`, `traceroute` ‚Üí connectivity & routing checks.  
- `ipconfig` / `ifconfig` ‚Üí verify network configs in **incident response**.  
- `netstat` ‚Üí check for suspicious open ports/connections.  
- `nslookup` / `dig` ‚Üí detect DNS misconfigurations/spoofing.  
- `curl` / `wget` ‚Üí test APIs, TLS configs, and HTTP responses.  

### 5. Tools & Security Use Cases  
- **Wireshark** ‚Äì deep packet inspection to detect anomalies, malware traffic, or intrusions.  
- **Nmap** ‚Äì scans systems for open ports/services, revealing potential attack surfaces.  
- **SSH vs Telnet** ‚Äì shows the difference between secure (encrypted SSH) and insecure (plain text Telnet) remote logins.  
- **Firewalls & Security Groups** ‚Äì enforce **least privilege** at the network layer in both on-prem and cloud.

## üí° Tips & Tricks I Learned  
- Always map issues to the **OSI model** for troubleshooting.  
- Default open ports (22, 80, 443) = common attack surface.  
- DNS is one of the **most targeted services** ‚Üí monitor & secure with DNSSEC.  
- Use **private subnets** + security groups for least-privilege cloud design.  
- Monitor traffic continuously with tools like **VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, Wireshark**.
