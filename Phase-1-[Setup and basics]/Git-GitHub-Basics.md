# Phase 1 â€“ Git & GitHub

This phase covers my introduction to **Git** (version control) and **GitHub** (cloud-based repository hosting).  
I learned how to track changes, collaborate on projects, and maintain clean project histories.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

### 1. Git Basics
- What is Git and why version control is important
- Initializing a repository (`git init`)
- Staging changes (`git add`)
- Committing changes (`git commit`)
- Viewing history (`git log`, `git status`)

### 2. GitHub Basics
- Creating a repository on GitHub
- Cloning a repository locally
- Pushing commits to remote (`git push`)
- Pulling updates from remote (`git pull`)
- Linking local repo to GitHub (`git remote add origin`)

### 3. Branching & Merging
- Creating a new branch (`git branch <name>`)
- Switching branches (`git checkout <name>`)
- Merging changes (`git merge <branch>`)

### 4. README & Markdown
- Creating `README.md` files for documentation
- Using Markdown syntax for headings, lists, links, and images

- [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) â€“ Comprehensive Git guide
 *I studied this book for a full day and thought it was really well written and simple to understand. I was able to quickly understand Git concepts thanks to the concise, beginner-friendly explanations and useful examples. It is the ideal resource to consult whenever necessary because it is an all-inclusive guide that covers everything from fundamentals to more complex subjects.*

- ["Complete Git and GitHub Tutorial for Beginners" by Apna College](https://youtu.be/Ez8F0nW6S-w?si=FRJEVyn6s7IDw4NC)  

*I chose these videos because they are very beginner-friendly. As an Indian learner, these two videos helped me a lot.  
Specifically, Kunal Kushwahaâ€™s video provides a deep understanding and covers a wide range of topics in just one hour, making it valuable for global learners since itâ€™s in English.  
Apna Collegeâ€™s video is also beginner-friendly, explaining topics with diagrams and simple definitions in Hindi.  
You can choose either depending on your preference â€” both are excellent in their own way.*

## ðŸ’¡ Tips & Tricks I Learned
- Always run `git status` before committing â€” it prevents mistakes.
- Commit in small, meaningful chunks, not huge unrelated changes.
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid pushing unnecessary files.
- Name branches descriptively (e.g., `feature-login`, `fix-bug-101`).
- Use `git log --oneline --graph` to visualize commit history.

## âœ… Summary
During this stage, I learnt how to use GitHub efficiently and established the framework for version control using Git.  
Collaboration, maintaining project organisation, and participating in open-source or team projects all require this knowledge.
