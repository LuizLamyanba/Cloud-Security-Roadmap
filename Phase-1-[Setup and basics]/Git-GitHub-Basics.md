# Phase 1 ‚Äì Git & GitHub

This phase covers my introduction to **Git** (version control) and **GitHub** (cloud-based repository hosting).  
I learned how to track changes, collaborate on projects, and maintain clean project histories.

## üìö What I Learned

### 1. Git Basics
- What is Git and why version control is important
- Initializing a repository (`git init`)
- Staging changes (`git add`)
- Committing changes (`git commit`)
- Viewing history (`git log`, `git status`)

### 2. GitHub Basics
- Creating a repository on GitHub
- Cloning a repository locally
- Pushing commits to remote (`git push`)
- Pulling updates from remote (`git pull`)
- Linking local repo to GitHub (`git remote add origin`)

### 3. Branching & Merging
- Creating a new branch (`git branch <name>`)
- Switching branches (`git checkout <name>`)
- Merging changes (`git merge <branch>`)

### 4. README & Markdown
- Creating `README.md` files for documentation
- Using Markdown syntax for headings, lists, links, and images

## üí° Tips & Tricks I Learned
- Always run `git status` before committing ‚Äî it prevents mistakes.
- Commit in small, meaningful chunks, not huge unrelated changes.
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid pushing unnecessary files.
- Name branches descriptively (e.g., `feature-login`, `fix-bug-101`).
- Use `git log --oneline --graph` to visualize commit history.

## ‚úÖ Summary
During this stage, I learnt how to use GitHub efficiently and established the framework for version control using Git.  
Collaboration, maintaining project organisation, and participating in open-source or team projects all require this knowledge.
